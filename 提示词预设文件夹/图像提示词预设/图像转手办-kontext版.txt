Please make this photo into a plastic model. Behind it, a computer displays its model, and beside it is a figurine box with the model of this photo and the manufacturer printed on it, slightly tilted. In front of the computer, on a circular plastic base, place the model version of the photo I gave you. The Angle of the model should be changed. I hope the PVC material can be clearly marked. It would be even better if the background is set indoors. If it's half body, the full body needs to be completed
